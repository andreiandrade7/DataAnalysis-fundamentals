# DataAnalysis-fundamentals
Work developed in the scope of "Fundamentals of Data Analysis" module

Task 1:
Collatz algorithm

Task 2:
Types of variables on data set penguins.csv


Task 3:
Review the probability density functions, select the most adequate to each type of variable on the penguins dataset. Normal probability density function for the continuous variables.For the categorical variables multinomial was suggested for  "species" and "islands" variables and a binominal for the "sex"

Task 4:
not none yet

Task 5:
Plot all the variables in adequate plots. 
  Variables: histogram with probability density function - normal distribution selected
  Categorical: bar plot for each one of the 3 variables
